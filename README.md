"Reverse Engineering On Vulnerable APK"

Allsafe is a purposely vulnerable Android application designed for security testing and educational purposes. Unlike typical Capture The Flag (CTF) apps, Allsafe simulates real-world scenarios and incorporates modern libraries and technologies. This makes it a valuable target for practicing reverse engineering and mobile application security testing.
